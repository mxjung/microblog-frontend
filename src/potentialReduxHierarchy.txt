state = {posts, comments}

posts: {
          id: {
            id,
            title,
            description,
            body
          }
}

comments: {
          post.id: {
                    commentId: commentBody
          }
}

// Redux:
state ={postLists }
in postDetail, we would have useState (component specific) that contains data given from API call to posts/:id
